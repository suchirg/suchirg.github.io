							<h1 class="major">The Legend of Zelda (NES) Remake</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ZeldaCombined.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" /></span>
							<p>This is a remake of the first dungeon, "Eagle", from the Legend of Zelda for NES. This was developed over a course of three weeks as the first project of EECS 494 at the University of Michigan.
								The dungeon was designed to have the authenticity of the original game, with the same weapons, enemies, and mechanics. Aside from the replicating the original game, we were 
								tasked with designing a custom level of our own that employed a new mechanic not seen in the Zelda franchise. Inspired by the thought of making a puzzle game, I
								thought a dungeon based on using portals to solve puzzels would be a fun challenge to not only make, but also for players as they face interesting challenges in each room. 
							</p>

							<p> I used Photoshop to make the sprites for all of the new game objects not found in the original level (The portals, portal gun, cube, wires, etc.)
								and C# with Unity to develop the game. This was a team project so for version control we used Git and for project management we used Atlassian Jira.</p>

							<p>Controls:
								<ul>
									<li>Arrow Keys to move</li>
									<li>'X' for weapon in A slot</li>
									<li>'Z' for weapon in B slot</li>
									<li>'Space' to switch B slot weapon</li>
									<li>'4' to exit to Menu</li>
								</ul>  
							</p>
							
							<p>GAME HERE</p> 

							<p>In the original game, my contribution consisted of working on half of the enemy AI, locked door mechanics, enemy spawn and despawn (when moving through doors), and most of the animations. 
								I also worked on ensuring level authenticity which consisted of making certain enemies drop keys, doors unlocking when enemies in room were defeated, and the special weapon spawns.</p>
							
							<p>In the custom level, my contributions included the level design, developing the activation mechanic (cubes on plates activate wires, blocks, and doors), interactions with the moving cubes 
								(attack to pull), and the portal link mechanics.</p>
